– Developed a hybrid Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict logic synthesis power (QoR) from circuit structure and synthesis recipe.
– Applied K-Means clustering on recipe embeddings to identify representative sequences, reducing labeling effort for fine-tuning.
– Achieved 6% absolute power prediction error on small, medium, and large benchmark circuits after few-shot fine-tuning.
